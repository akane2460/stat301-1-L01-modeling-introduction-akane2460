## Overview

This lab has two main objectives. The first is to ensure all relevant software for this course is properly installed, functional, and up-to-date. The second objective, is to build understanding of fundamental modeling concepts (prediction vs. inference, classification vs. regression, and mechanistic vs. empirically driven models). Additionally, students are also asked to perform small EDAs, which should be a review to those who took STAT 301-1.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L01_modeling_introduction.html`. A template is also provided. Complete work for the exercises in a separate R script file. Upload additional datasets in the processed folder. 

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
